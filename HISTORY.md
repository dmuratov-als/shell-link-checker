- The output to $file_wget_errors is flushed without buffering
- The number of URLs in $file_wget_errors is displayed
- Fixed: Projects or files with names starting with a hyphen no longer cause problems
- Fixed: For the scripts run interactively, shell options were not restored if the script exited before reaching the end of the main() function
- Fixed: Incorrect counting of characters instead of lines when there was only one line in $file_wget_errors
- Fixed: In the script 2, "division by zero attempted" occurred when the supplied URL produced an error (downloaded = 0)
- Fixed: In the script 2, added error response detection when the `--retry-all-errors` curl option is set
- Fixed: In the script 2, the shell error is not displayed when the path to the project is incorrect

#### v2.6.0 (20250705)
- New: failed requests during Wget spidering are now reported in $file_wget_errors
- Fixed: leading and trailing spaces, and all tabs in TITLE, etc. are now properly preserved by quoting the string in $file_curl_summary
- Fixed: double quotes in TITLE, etc. are now properly escaped in $file_curl_summary
- The resulting file list now includes "B" for bytes
- Removing duplicates is now performed with awk (which is memory-consuming in the case of hundreds of thousands of URLs, but saves on disk I/O operations)
- Removed saving duplicates to $file_wget_sitemap (due to both HEAD and GET requests being made)
- Regular expressions and range matches in gawk are tighter
- The superfluous decimal part in the "queued" number has been fixed
- Variables, open files and commands are now reset or closed in awk when they are no longer needed
  
#### v2.5.0 (20250123)

- Added a check for minimum zsh version and availability of zsh modules
- Broader detection of custom URL schemes, the tel and callto schemes are no longer singled out, nor are the tel links included in the broken links report
- Fixed a bug when a wrong URL scheme was interpreted as the userinfo URL subcomponent (as "email:someone@domain.tld" instead of "mailto:someone@domain.tld")

- Fixed a bug when exiting a script would close the current interactive shell
- Fixed a bug when empty URL list file triggered creation of the $address_file variable

- Error messages when parsing the manifest and browserconfig.xml files are redirected to /dev/null
- Error messages for $file_wget_sitemap_tree are redirected to /dev/null
- Fixed the incorrect "Wget completed" message attribution for the "notify-send" command in the script 2
- Naming and messages/dialogs phrasing are more semantic, consistent, and clear
- Multiple code changes and improvements

#### v2.4.2 (20240709)

- Added reading URLs from a file

- Date of the $file_broken_links file is taken at the end of the process, not at the beginning (useful if checking takes a day or a week)
- If the $subtree_only option is enabled, only relevant links are displayed
- The $subtree_only option now works correctly with URLs with or without trailing slashes.
- Improved error reporting
- Custom options do not overwrite the required ones
- Additional checks that all required files are present
- Single quotes in TITLE/og:title/description/og:description are unescaped

- Some modifications to the in-scope URL definition

#### v2.3.1
- The ${project}-curl-links.tsv file renamed to ${project}-curl-summary.tsv
- The existing $file_broken_links files do not trigger the "Overwrite existing files?" dialog
- The previous (or empty) files are removed upon subsequent script runs, not overwritten
- Some minor code changes

#### v2.3.0
- Added: if username and password were provided in the script 1, the script 2 tries to use them.
- Changed: the timestamp, which is appended to the $file_broken_links filename, now includes hours and minutes. There is also a dialog to compress the file.
- Changed: the curl output is set to verbose by default.
- Fixed a bug where some URLs were skipped when checking for empty TITLE.
- Fixed a bug where $file_wget_links_abs_refs was not reset.
- Fixed a bug where a parameter substitution was applied to a missing $TMPDIR.
- Fixed a bug where a non-root $folder was not created.

- Some minor code changes.

#### v2.2.0
- The missing TITLE tag is reported.
- The Wget --exclude-domains option is not to be used (more info: it produces the same "The domain was not accepted" log message as the --include-domains option does, which we can not differentiate, and the latter is more important for us.)
- Fixed a bug when an URLs was not correctly converted to lowercase
- Fixed a bug with a concurrent execution of the Wget script when temporary files of the one process were read by the other.
- Fixed a bug with the "#" symbol being percent encoded.
- The wc, and numfmt utilities are no longer needed, and the du, and xmllint utilities are optional

#### v2.1.1
- Added a dialogue if existing files should be overwritten in case of a repeated script run

- Fixed a bug when the --exclude-directories, --exclude-domains, and --reject Wget options were not respected

- Some minor checks, code changes and clarifications on how to specify custom options

#### v2.1.0
- Disallowed URLs should be excluded manually with the reject-regex option, as Wget considers the robots.txt check expensive and stores these URLs in a blacklist, which leads to an inconsistent log reporting (see src/recur.c)
- Links with the "unsafe:" prefix (which is, for example, set by Angular) are not excluded when $internal_only is on
- Fixed the "zsh: invalid subscript" error caused by some symbols (for example, a comma) in an URL

- Email addresses are harvested and checked for validity (against a regexp and by MX record)

- Links being processed are numbered and the connection time is shown to get the idea of how the things are going, as well as the elapsed time
- Sitemap generation
- If Wget exited with an error, the debug information is shown
- The number of redirects is recorded

#### v1.3.0
- Suspend/resume support (Ctrl+Z)
